# tree-species-segmentation-using-UNet-model-architecture
This project uses a U-Net model to segment tree species from satellite images. It features preprocessing (image patchification), custom loss functions (focal and dice loss), and Jaccard-based evaluation. Tools like QGIS, SAM plugin, and ArcMap were used for mask preparation. Includes end-to-end workflow for segmentation.
